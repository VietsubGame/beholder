Hello, little one!

2
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:07,061
Today, we will tell you
a wise tale of three piglets.

3
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:13,753
Once upon a time, there was a huge apartment
complex managed by the Grey Wolf.

4
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:17,633
Three piglets, all of whom were brothers, lived there.

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:22,659
Their names were Nih-Nih,
Nah-Nah, and Nuh-Nuh.

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:27,244
Nih-Nih was very poor:
he slept on a straw mattress

7
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:30,964
and used a rag nailed
to the wall instead of a door.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:36,983
This little piglet had a dairy in which
he recorded all of his troubles with the landlord.

9
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:39,492
He was sure his home
was his fortress,

10
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:43,465
and believed nobody
would ever find his book.

11
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:46,892
Nah-Nah had more than his brother.

12
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:52,197
He had a real bed, and his door
was made of plywood and had a latch.

13
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:56,021
At night, Nah-Nah liked to
experiment with his radio.

14
00:00:56,021 --> 00:01:02,107
In time, he was able to tune into a foreign
radio station prohibited by the Grey Wolf.

15
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,502
Nuh-Nuh, the oldest, loved his life.

16
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,378
He had a king-size bed

17
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:12,150
and a sturdy oak door
with a huge iron lock.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,739
He worked in the Ministry of Groceries,

19
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:20,354
and lived high on the hog,
selling stolen food to his brothers.

20
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:25,139
Then came the day when
the Grey Wolf ran out of patience.

21
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:30,469
He pulled aside the little brother's rag,
knocked out the middle one's plywood door,

22
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,539
and unlocked the oldest one's oak door.

23
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:41,001
Then he took the fat, lazy piglets to the factory
to be turned into delicious sausages.

24
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,124
He then gave the links
to the other tenants -

25
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:51,168
the very ones who had diligently watched and reported
the activities of the piglets to the Grey Wolf.

26
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:56,614
All this happened because the piglets forgot
who gave them everything they had.

27
00:01:56,614 --> 00:02:03,444
So remember, little one, it doesn't matter
how you live: the landlord sees it all!

28
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:07,397
Just be happy you don't get sausages
for dinner too often;

29
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:11,525
in means we don't have many
traitors among us!
