1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:03,385
You live in the best country
in the world!

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:05,889
And other countries
are jealous of you!

3
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:10,170
Each of our citizens receives
all he or she needs

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,649
to lead a happy and carefree life:

5
00:00:12,649 --> 00:00:17,000
soap, sugar, bread, and
certificates of appreciation!

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:21,744
Just remember: our foes are
continually plotting against us!

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:26,277
Thankfully, our Great Leader
effortlessly disperses the waves of terror

8
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:30,900
our treacherous enemies send
crashing upon our Great State.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,091
Still, you must be vigilant!

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,731
Keep an eye on your surroundings,
watch out for agents of sabotage,

11
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,194
and report every transgression!

12
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,869
Do not let aggressive imperialism

13
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:46,360
cast a shadow over
our labor and valor!

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,909
To counter the hostile attacks and
defend our right to live as we wish, 

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,144
we will move forward along
our own path,

16
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:57,503
and prove that the people
and the party are one!

17
00:00:57,503 --> 00:01:02,216
Our Great Leader is the mind, honor,
and conscience of the State!

18
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:04,564
May he live long and prosper!
